# Django-Learning

In this short training process, which is the first stage of my Django journey,

- First, I understood the MVT structure, which forms the basis of Django.

- Later, I saw how I could benefit from Django's modular structure, and learned that I could use an application I created over and over again in different projects.

- As an example educational project, I worked on a library. This study included general information and detailed information about each book.

- While doing my library project, I saw the DRY (Dont Repeat Yourself) approach, which is another nice feature of Django, and it made it very easy. With this approach, I saw the templates inheritance approach in order to avoid having to write and correct repetitive areas (such as Navbar, Sidebar, Header, Footer) on the pages of the project over and over again.
